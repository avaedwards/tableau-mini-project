# Tableau Mini Project

Project members:
Avary
Terry

For this project we decided to go with the same topic as our project3, looking at video games and genres, but we decided to find different data sets that would potentially be easier to work with, especially with a new program such as tableau. 

Since we are new to tableau and had limited time, we ended up working with different datasets and made different graphs, but under the same goal, to try and visualize video game data and expand on our last project
